Iterables are objects that can be iterated by <Snippet>for..of</Snippet> loop and can also return iterators explicitly.
The best examples are <Snippet>Array</Snippet>,<Snippet>Map</Snippet> and <Snippet>Set</Snippet> data structures in JavaScript.

### Symbol.iterator

<Snippet>Symbol.iterator</Snippet> is a well known system symbol in JavaScript. when
any object has a property of <Snippet>Symbol.iterator</Snippet> then that object
can be iterated over <Snippet>for..of</Snippet> loop. let's make our iterator to
understand how it works.

```js showLineNumbers
const range = {
  from: 1,
  to: 10,
};

// We want the for..of to work:
// for(let num of range) ...
```

Currently, the range object does not have <Snippet>Symbol.iterator</Snippet> property, Therefore if we try using <Snippet>for..of</Snippet> loop it will throw an error. As we discussed to make the range object iterable we need to add the iterable property.

<Note>
  Remember the <Snippet>Symbol.iterator</Snippet> must return an object having
  the next method.
</Note>

```js showLineNumbers
const range = {
  from: 1,
  to: 5,
};

range[Symbol.iterator] = function () {
  let start = this.from;
  let end = this.to;
  return {
    next() {
      if (start <= end) return { done: false, value: start++ };
      //^closure applied
      return { done: true, value: undefined };
    },
  };
};

for (let num of range) {
  console.log(num); // 1 2 3 4 5
}
```

Similarly, you can add the property to an object and make it iterate as you like. If you have noticed <Snippet>string</Snippet> type is iterable with <Snippet>for..of</Snippet> loop, it also has implemented the property and returns characters at each iteration.

<Note>
  {" "}
  Remember that the next method should return the object having
  <Snippet>done</Snippet> and <Snippet>value</Snippet> property.
</Note>

```js showLineNumbers
const str = "Hello";
for (let char of str) {
  console.log(char); // H e l l o
}
```

### Explicit iterator

You can also directly access the <Snippet>Symbol.iterator</Snippet> property and call it and it will return an iterator object in which you have <Snippet>next()</Snippet> method.

```js showLineNumbers
const itr = range[Symbol.iterator]();
while (true) {
  const { done, val } = itr.next();
  if (done) break;
  console.log(val); // 1 2 3 4 5
}
```

This is also helpful when you want only a few items from the iterator or the iterator is infinitely long.

### Spread Operator <Snippet>(...)</Snippet>

You might be using the spread operator very often but if you keenly observe the spread operator works based on the <Snippet>Symbol.iterator</Snippet> property only. it also iterates under the hood and provides you with spread values. let's recall the spread operator and let's see whether our <Snippet>range</Snippet> object can do it or not.

```js showLineNumbers
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(...arr); // 1, 2, 3

const str = "hello";
console.log(...str); // h, e, l, l, o

// our range obj
console.log(...range); // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

Yes, it will work because our range object has an iterator property. you can assign it to an array or other data structure or pass it as a spread parameter etc.

### Generator function <Snippet>function\*</Snippet>

Regular functions return only one, single value (or nothing). Generators can return <Snippet>(“yield”)</Snippet> multiple values, one after another, on-demand. They work great with iterables, allowing you to create data streams with ease.
Generators make your life easy to make iterators. To create a generator, we need a special syntax construct: <Snippet>function\*</Snippet>, the so-called “generator function”.

```js
function* generateRange() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
  yield 4;
  yield 5;
}
```

You can also specify <Snippet>Symbol.iterator</Snippet> with a generator function and it not only reduces code but also enhances readability.
Let's rewrite our range iterator with the generator function.

```js
const range = {
  from: 1,
  to: 10,
};

range[Symbol.iterator] = function* () {
  let start = this.from;
  let end = this.to;
  while (start <= end) {
    yield start;
    start++;
  }
};

// still works the same for..of loop
for (let num of range) {
  console.log(num); // 1 2 3 4 5
}

// explicit iterator
const generator = range[Symbol.iterator]();
generator.next(); // { "value": 1, "done": false }
```

### Summary

Objects that can be used in for..of are called iterable.

- Technically, iterables must implement the method named Symbol.iterator.
  - The result of <Snippet>obj[Symbol.iterator]\()</Snippet> is called an iterator. It handles further iteration processes.
  - An iterator must have the method named <Snippet>next()</Snippet> that returns an object with done and next, here done:true denotes the end of the iteration process, otherwise the value is the next value.
- The Symbol.iterator method is called automatically by for..of, but we also can do it directly.
- Built-in iterables like strings or arrays, also implement Symbol.iterator.
- String iterator knows about surrogate pairs.
