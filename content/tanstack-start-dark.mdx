Recently, I started rewriting my project using the TanStack Start framework. One of the features I wanted to implement early on was a light/dark mode toggle. My initial approach used localStorage to store the user's preference, but I quickly ran into a common issue — a flash of incorrect theme on the initial page load.

I didn’t want that flickering experience, especially when aiming for a polished UI. So I switched gears and moved the theme handling to the server side by storing the preference in a cookie instead. This way, the correct theme gets applied during SSR itself — no more flickering.

Let’s see how the implementation goes.

I started by creating two `serverFn` — `getThemeServerFn` and `setThemeServerFn`. The goal was simple:

- `getThemeServerFn` retrieves the current theme from the cookie (if present) or falls back to a default.
- `setThemeServerFn` updates the cookie with the new theme value.

This approach ensures the theme is handled on the server, which prevents flickering on initial load and keeps the experience consistent across pages and refreshes.

Let’s take a look at the code:

```ts:@/lib/theme.ts showLineNumbers {8,18}
import { Theme } from "@/components/theme-provider";
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { getCookie, setCookie } from "@tanstack/react-start/server";

const storageKey = "_ui_theme";

export const getThemeSeverFn = createServerFn().handler(async () => {
  return (getCookie(storageKey) || "light") as Theme;
});

export const setThemeSeverFn = createServerFn({ method: "POST" })
  .validator((data: unknown) => {
    if (typeof data != "string" && (data != "dark" || data != "light"))
      throw new Error("Invalid theme provided");
    return data as Theme;
  })
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    setCookie(storageKey, data);
  });
```

Now let’s use this `getThemeServerFn` in our `__root.tsx` to determine the theme during SSR. In TanStack, while defining a route, we can pass a `loader` function that runs on the server before rendering the content. This gives us the perfect place to use our `serverFn` and fetch the theme ahead of time.

We’ll use this theme value inside our document to ensure the correct mode is applied right from the initial render — no flickering, no flashes.

> Our ultimate goal is simple: if the user should be shown a dark theme, we want to add a `dark` class to the root HTML tag.

Let’s see the code in action:

```tsx:__root.tsx showLineNumbers {5,9,11}
import { getThemeSeverFn } from "@/lib/theme";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: RootComponent,
  loader: () => getThemeSeverFn(),
});

function RootDocument({ children }: PropsWithChildren) {
  const theme = Route.useLoaderData();
  return (
    <html className={theme} suppressHydrationWarning>
      <head>
        <HeadContent />
      </head>
      <body className="font-regular antialiased tracking-wide">
        {children}
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Until here it's fine, but we also need access to the current theme on the client so we can modify it based on user preference. To achieve this, we’ll create a `Context` that holds the current theme and provides a function to update it.

The context will take the initial theme coming from the server and expose a `setTheme` function. This function will trigger the `setThemeServerFn` and then invalidate the page. By doing this, we ensure the app re-renders with the updated theme applied directly from the server.

Let’s dive into how this setup works:

```tsx:@/components/theme-provider.tsx showLineNumbers
import { setThemeSeverFn } from "@/lib/theme";
import { useRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

import { createContext, PropsWithChildren, use, useState } from "react";

export type Theme = "light" | "dark";

type ThemeContextVal = { theme: Theme; setTheme: (val: Theme) => void };

type Props = PropsWithChildren<{ theme: Theme }>;

const ThemeContext = createContext<ThemeContextVal | null>(null);

export function ThemeProvider({ children, theme } : Props) {
  const [_theme, _setTheme] = useState(theme);
  const router = useRouter();

  function setTheme(val: Theme) {
    setThemeSeverFn({ data: val });
    _setTheme(val);
    router.invalidate();
  }

  return (
    <ThemeContext value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext>
  );
}

export function useTheme() {
  const val = use(ThemeContext);
  if (!val) throw new Error("useTheme called outside!");
  return val;
}
```

Now let’s make a few changes in the `__root.tsx` file to wrap our root component with the `ThemeProvider` and pass the initial theme to it. This ensures the entire app has access to the current theme context right from the start, using the value we fetched during SSR.

```tsx:__root.tsx showLineNumbers {1,10,12,21}
import { ThemeProvider, useTheme } from "@/components/theme-provider";
import { getThemeSeverFn } from "@/lib/theme";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: RootComponent,
  loader: () => getThemeSeverFn(),
});

function RootComponent() {
  const data = Route.useLoaderData();
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={data}>
      <RootDocument>
        <Outlet />
      </RootDocument>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

function RootDocument({ children }: PropsWithChildren) {
   const { theme } = useTheme();
  return (
    <html className={theme} suppressHydrationWarning>
      <head>
        <HeadContent />
      </head>
      <body className="font-regular antialiased tracking-wide">
        {children}
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Now all set — we’ve completed the dark/light mode implementation. We can now use the `useTheme` hook’s `setTheme` function anywhere in the app to update the theme, and it works like a charm.

Here’s a `ThemeToggle` component inspired by shadcn/ui. You can simply paste this code into your project and use it to toggle between light and dark themes directly from the UI.

```tsx:@/components/theme-toggle.tsx showLineNumbers
import { Moon, Sun } from "lucide-react";

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import {
  DropdownMenu,
  DropdownMenuContent,
  DropdownMenuItem,
  DropdownMenuTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/dropdown-menu";
import { useTheme } from "@/components/theme-provider";

export function ModeToggle() {
  const { setTheme } = useTheme();

  return (
    <DropdownMenu>
      <DropdownMenuTrigger asChild>
        <Button variant="ghost" size="icon">
          <Sun className="!h-[1.2rem] !w-[1.2rem] rotate-0 scale-100 transition-all dark:-rotate-90 dark:scale-0" />
          <Moon className="absolute !h-[1.2rem] !w-[1.2rem] rotate-90 scale-0 transition-all dark:rotate-0 dark:scale-100" />
          <span className="sr-only">Toggle theme</span>
        </Button>
      </DropdownMenuTrigger>
      <DropdownMenuContent align="end">
        <DropdownMenuItem onClick={() => setTheme("light")}>
          Light
        </DropdownMenuItem>
        <DropdownMenuItem onClick={() => setTheme("dark")}>
          Dark
        </DropdownMenuItem>
      </DropdownMenuContent>
    </DropdownMenu>
  );
}
```
