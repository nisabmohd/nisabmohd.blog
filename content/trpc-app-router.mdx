`tRPC` is great for building fullstack applications within a monorepo with type safety. `tRPC` is essentially an RPC call with added type safety, meaning if the procedure changes, the client will receive hints about type issues. `RPC` stands for **Remote Procedure Calls**—an alternative to `REST` and `GraphQL`. In `REST`, we call a URL with a payload using `HTTP` verbs, whereas `RPCs` are similar but, instead of calling URLs, we call functions.

`tRPC` is based on routers and procedures, where each procedure is callable as an endpoint. Procedures can be of type `query`, `mutation`, or `subscription`. `tRPC` creates a main router, commonly named `appRouter`, and the type of this router is imported on the client to infer the types of procedure calls. `tRPC` also provides seamless integration with `@tanstack/react-query`, enabling usage on the client side through auto-generated hooks. Server-side calls are also possible by creating a callable using a factory function.

`tRPC` can be used with multiple frameworks, but using it with `Next.js` is seamless and helps you understand the server–client model of React more clearly. In `Next.js` applications, there’s an imaginary boundary between the frontend and backend. Using Server Components for data fetching ensures type safety, but client-side fetching isn’t type-safe by default. This is where `tRPC` shines—when combined with `@tanstack/react-query`, it enables seamless, type-safe client-side fetching.

It also unlocks powerful features like prefetching data on the server and hydrating it on the client, removing the need for redundant client-side fetches. On-demand fetching on the client is still fully supported when needed.
Let's start with the setup in our `Next.js` application, specifically using the App Router. First, initialize a simple `Next.js` App Router project. Then, we’ll need a few libraries to set up `tRPC` properly.

```bash
npm install @trpc/server @trpc/client @trpc/react-query @tanstack/react-query@latest zod client-only server-only
```

After installing the required packages, we need to initialize `tRPC` on the server. Let's create a folder named `trpc` to keep all `tRPC`-related logic organized.

```ts:trpc/init.ts
import { initTRPC } from "@trpc/server";
import { cache } from "react";
import superjson from "superjson";

export const createTRPCContext = cache(async () => {
  return {
    // auth : ...
  };
});

const t = initTRPC.create({
  transformer: superjson,
});

export const createTRPCRouter = t.router;
export const createCallerFactory = t.createCallerFactory;
export const baseProcedure = t.procedure;
```

Next, we create the main router for our `tRPC` server and export it along with its `typeof` so that we can use it later in our client-side code.

```ts:trpc/routers/_app.ts
import { z } from "zod";
import { baseProcedure, createTRPCRouter } from "../init";

export const appRouter = createTRPCRouter({
  hello: baseProcedure
    .input(
      z.object({
        text: z.string(),
      })
    )
    .query(async (opts) => {
      return {
        greeting: `hello ${opts.input.text}`,
      };
    }),
});

// export type definition of API
export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;
```

Now, let's set up our `Next.js` endpoint that listens to `tRPC` calls and forwards them to our `tRPC` fetch adapter handler. This way, any request to the `Next.js` API route will be handled by `tRPC`.

```ts:app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts
import { fetchRequestHandler } from "@trpc/server/adapters/fetch";
import { createTRPCContext } from "@/trpc/init";
import { appRouter } from "@/trpc/routers/_app";

const handler = (req: Request) =>
  fetchRequestHandler({
    endpoint: "/api/trpc",
    req,
    router: appRouter,
    createContext: createTRPCContext,
  });

export { handler as GET, handler as POST };
```

Now we create a `tRPC` server file for our server-side `tRPC` helpers. This will export the `tRPC` client for the server and a `HydrateClient` component, which can be used to wrap our Server Components when prefetching is done.

```ts:trpc/query-client.ts
import {
  defaultShouldDehydrateQuery,
  QueryClient,
} from "@tanstack/react-query";
import superjson from "superjson";

export function makeQueryClient() {
  return new QueryClient({
    defaultOptions: {
      queries: {
        staleTime: 30 * 1000,
      },
      dehydrate: {
        serializeData: superjson.serialize,
        shouldDehydrateQuery: (query) =>
          defaultShouldDehydrateQuery(query) ||
          query.state.status === "pending",
      },
      hydrate: {
        deserializeData: superjson.deserialize,
      },
    },
  });
}
```

```ts:trpc/server.ts
import "server-only";

import { createHydrationHelpers } from "@trpc/react-query/rsc";
import { cache } from "react";
import { createCallerFactory, createTRPCContext } from "./init";
import { makeQueryClient } from "./query-client";
import { appRouter } from "./routers/_app";

export const getQueryClient = cache(makeQueryClient);

const caller = createCallerFactory(appRouter)(createTRPCContext);

const { trpc, HydrateClient } = createHydrationHelpers<typeof appRouter>(
  caller,
  getQueryClient
);

export {trpc,HydrateClient}
```

Finally, we create a client component helper for our client-side `tRPC`. From here, we export a provider that wraps our application with both the `tRPC` provider and the `TanStack Query` provider. We also export the `tRPC` client for client-side fetching.

```tsx:trpc/react.tsx
"use client";

import type { QueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { httpBatchLink } from "@trpc/client";
import { createTRPCReact } from "@trpc/react-query";
import { PropsWithChildren, useState } from "react";
import { makeQueryClient } from "./query-client";
import type { AppRouter } from "./routers/_app";
import superjson from "superjson";

export const trpc = createTRPCReact<AppRouter>();

let clientQueryClientSingleton: QueryClient;
function getQueryClient() {
  // For server create new client
  if (typeof window === "undefined") return makeQueryClient();
  return (clientQueryClientSingleton ??= makeQueryClient());
}

function getUrl() {
  // need to change for deploy url
  return "http://localhost:3000";
}

export function TRPCProvider(props: PropsWithChildren) {
  const queryClient = getQueryClient();
  const [trpcClient] = useState(() =>
    trpc.createClient({
      links: [
        httpBatchLink({
          transformer: superjson,
          url: getUrl(),
        }),
      ],
    })
  );

  return (
    <trpc.Provider client={trpcClient} queryClient={queryClient}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        {props.children}
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </trpc.Provider>
  );
}
```

All done! Now we can test our `tRPC` in both server and client components. In the server component, we can fetch data directly from our `tRPC` procedures, ensuring everything is fully type-safe on the server-side. On the client side, we can use the `tRPC` hooks, provided by the integration with `TanStack Query`, to fetch data from the server. This setup allows for seamless data fetching with type safety across the entire application.

```tsx:app/page.tsx
import { HydrateClient, trpc } from "@/trpc/server";
import ClientGreetings from "./client-greetings";
import { Suspense } from "react";

export default async function Home() {
  void trpc.hello.prefetch({ text: "Nisab" });

  return (
    <HydrateClient>
      <div>This rendered on server</div>
      <Suspense fallback="Loading....">
        <ClientGreetings />
      </Suspense>
    </HydrateClient>
  );
}
```

```tsx:app/client-greetings.tsx
"use client";

import { trpc } from "@/trpc/react";

export default function ClientGreetings() {
  const [res] = trpc.hello.useSuspenseQuery({ text: "Nisab" });
  return <div>{res.greeting}</div>;
}
```

In conclusion, by integrating `tRPC` with `Next.js`, we can build a highly efficient, type-safe full-stack application. The separation between server and client components in `Next.js` becomes much more streamlined with `tRPC`, and features like prefetching, hydration, and on-demand data fetching are much easier to implement. This setup improves both the developer experience and application performance, making `tRPC` a great choice for modern full-stack applications.
