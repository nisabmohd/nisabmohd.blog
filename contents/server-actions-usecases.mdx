> Server action are asyncronous function that are executed on server.

A common conversation among Next and React developers is regarding server action on forms, which is a react component that extends traditional forms and allows you to send an action prop.

{/* When server actions were in their early phases, they were only demonstrated with forms; however, as server actions became more stable, they opened up a plethora of other uses that were never explored or included. */}

### Convention :

Server actions are peice of code that is runned on the server triggered by client or server components. A server component can be made very easily marking an async function with `use server` directive.

###### 1. Marking a file with use server and define server components in it.

This can be used even by client components by importing them and also can be used with server components

```tsx
"use server";
export async function create() {
  // ...
}
```

###### 2. Making an async function within server component

This method is useful when you have an action that is only required at one place. The create action will never reach client even though it is created in a
component.

```tsx
// Server Component
export default function Page() {
  // Server Action
  async function create() {
    'use server'

    // ...
  }

  return (
    // ...
  )
}
```

### Using server action in forms

React introduces the form component, a wrapper for the standard HTML form element that uses an action prop to trigger a server action upon form submission. This component can be used in client and server components. The most recent react dom hooks, `useFormStatus` & `useFormState`, can be used with client components.

```tsx
export default function LoginPage() {
  return <form action={login}></form>;
}
```

### Event handlers

Event handlers such as onClick and onChange can initiate server operations when client components require engagement. Although you can start a server action, React advises taking care of the client's progressivity to enhance the user experience.

```tsx
"use client";

import { incrementLike } from "./actions";
import { useState } from "react";

export default function LikeButton({ initialLikes }: { initialLikes: number }) {
  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(initialLikes);

  return (
    <>
      <p>Total Likes: {likes}</p>
      <button
        onClick={async () => {
          const updatedLikes = await incrementLike();
          setLikes(updatedLikes);
        }}
      >
        Like
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Calling inside useEffects

You can use the React useEffect hook to invoke a Server Action when the component mounts or a dependency changes. Remember to consider the behavior and caveats of useEffect.

```tsx
"use client";

import { incrementViews } from "./actions";
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

export default function ViewCount({ initialViews }: { initialViews: number }) {
  const [views, setViews] = useState(initialViews);

  useEffect(() => {
    const updateViews = async () => {
      const updatedViews = await incrementViews();
      setViews(updatedViews);
    };

    updateViews();
  }, []);

  return <p>Total Views: {views}</p>;
}
```

When utilising server actions, please take client-to-server security into consideration. These are fantastic, brand-new features that address a very specific use case involving the running of some code on the server.
